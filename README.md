## Layout & Style Notes

### Scroll Effects

#### Refs

I've tried a few times now to create parallax effects using javascript. At my current skill level, they've all been disappointing. However, I've learned a little by banging my head against the same wall.

I think, for Naomi's About Page, I should style each Section as I want, and apply scroll animations when the ref becomes visible, and when it scrolls out of view. This is what I achieved on lgmanagement, and I bet I can figure out much cooler effects with some images, etc.

I also may be able to incorporate subtle parallax effects on images, using javascript.

There should be a way to ask a ref if it is visible. There is a version of this that exists within RN FlatLists. Let's look up "ref is visible," ideas, and see what we find.

Look up Intersection Observer API and read the page on mdn web docs
new Observer();
